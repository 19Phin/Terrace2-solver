# Terrace2-solver
Just a program I whipped up to help debug the map The Terrace 2: Worlds.

Right-click to cycle between must be on (black) must be off (white) and neither (grey).
Left-click to cycle between dotted square options
Number keys to change color, by default adds a "+". (which number doesn't matter as long as it's the same for each color)
Backtick "`" and number key to add dice block, must have a color first.
