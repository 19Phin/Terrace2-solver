# Terrace2-solver

Terrace2-solver is a simple utility program I created to aid in debugging maps for The Terrace 2: Worlds.

## Features

- **Right-click:** Cycle between "must be on" (black), "must be off" (white), and "neither" (grey).
- **Left-click:** Cycle between different dotted square options.
- **Number keys:** Change the color, with a default addition of "+" (the specific number doesn't matter, as long as it's the same for each color).
- **Backtick (\`) and number key:** Add a dice block; note that you must select a color first.
